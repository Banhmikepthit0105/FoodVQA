Florets of cauliflower, off-white to pale yellow, are scattered throughout the soup. Dark green kale leaves are mixed in with the cauliflower. Crumbs of brown sausage are distributed around the top of the soup. A few pieces of pale yellow onion are visible. Some pieces of slightly orange fried meat are present on top of the soup as well."

There are also chunks of potato, which are light yellow. Green kale leaves are scattered throughout the soup. Small bits of crispy brown bacon are also visible. A light sprinkling of white cheese is on top of the soup. One bowl is in the lower left quadrant, and the other is in the upper right quadrant."

The soup consists of off-white or light tan colored barley, cream-colored beans, and thin slices of orange carrots. Scattered throughout are dark black slivers of wild rice and pieces of pink and white bacon. The beans appear oval and are located throughout the bottom half of the bowl. The barley grains appear slightly more transparent and fill the spaces in between. The orange carrot pieces are dispersed and scattered around, with some near the center. The dark, black wild rice is also scattered, offering a color contrast to the lighter ingredients. Overall, the food is concentrated toward the bottom of the frame."

A thick layer of dark brown chocolate pudding follows. Another layer of soaked sponge cake is on top of the chocolate. Then there is a layer of white whipped cream. Red cherries are densely arranged on top of the whipped cream, with some scattered almond slivers."
