The soup consists of off-white or light tan colored barley, cream-colored beans, and thin slices of orange carrots. Scattered throughout are dark black slivers of wild rice and pieces of pink and white bacon. The beans appear oval and are located throughout the bottom half of the bowl. The barley grains appear slightly more transparent and fill the spaces in between. The orange carrot pieces are dispersed and scattered around, with some near the center. The dark, black wild rice is also scattered, offering a color contrast to the lighter ingredients. Overall, the food is concentrated toward the bottom of the frame."

Red cherries are densely arranged on top of the whipped cream, with some scattered almond slivers."
